# Malware Detection using CNN 

Malware Detection model classifies given suspicious binary applications to a malware family, to prevent any threats to organization
while installing the application across the projects. This will help organization bolster itâ€™s position from compliance perspective. 
Further, the model can be used to scan spam images in the email to detect any malwares.

Use Case:
Proactive measure to prevent spreading of malwares due to unauthorized installation of binaries by internal employees. 
Prevent image based suspicious emails with the help of spam email prevention software repository.
Detect malwares in network streams with the help of network stream scanning software repository.

Approach:
Build model using Keras Convolutional Neural Network API and Python language. Train, test and evaluate it using standard malware binary samples. 
Save model in Database or secure SharePoint/server location.
Deploy model as a Rest Service using Flask micro service.
Load model dynamically and apply to applications binaries using either html based UI or via other applications using REST endpoints.
Use tensor board to verify the accuracy of the model for given epoch cycles.
Retrain the model using new binaries and save the model with new features on to Database.

Impact:
Improved Threat Detection
Improved Security Compliance across the organization.
Reutilization across the projects for different use cases. E.g. Malware detection in image based spam emails, malware detections in network traffic.
